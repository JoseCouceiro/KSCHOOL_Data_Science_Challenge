### KSCHOOL MIDTERM DATA SCIENCE CHALLENGE
This repository contains a partially guided exercise from the master's degree in data sience that I took at KSchool.

It contains the following files:
- A pdf with the exercise's statements
- A jupyter notebook with the solution to the first 4 exercises.
- A python file that is the solution to the 5th and last question.
- A requirements.txt file to install the conda environment with the packages necessary to run the notebook and the python file. Run "$ conda create --name <your_env> --file requirements.txt" in the command line to install them.
